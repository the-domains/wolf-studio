description: 'Wolf Studio is a visual communications design firm specialising in Editorial Design and Corporate Design. Founded in 1999, Wolf Studio was based in Paris for over fifteen years. Today we make our home in Zurich, from where we operate on an international scale. Working together with photographers and illustrators, copywriters and editors, translators and printers, we take a holistic approach to our projects – from consulting and strategic concept development to visual implementation on screen and paper. We conceptualise and design books and magazines, identities, and exhibition graphics for cultural institutions and companies from museums and publishers to artists, authors, architects, and fashion labels. The shape of each individual project depends on its content and its purpose. We cut to the heart of each project’s message, putting our ideas into practice with meticulous attention to detail. We believe that timeless design, well-designed advertising art, and high-quality implementation are more successful in the long run than overly stylised design and short-lived trends. We love a challenge and we love to work with clients who share our values. Welcome to Wolf Studio. Samuel Wolf (b. 1968) worked at a graphic arts studio in Paris for four years before starting his own business as a graphic designer and art director. His clients include cultural institutions (Centre Pompidou, Musée d’Art Moderne, Musée Picasso Antibes) and magazines (Citizen K, L’Officiel de la Mode, Vogue Hommes International). He relocated to Switzerland in 2011.'
